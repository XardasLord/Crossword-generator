# Crossword-generator

This is an application that generates the crossword for the given password. The given list of words and clues contains over 89000 different words in Polish language. You can overrite the file **DictionaryWordList.txt** in the **Resources** folder in the project with the words and clues in the different language. The file has to be save in the pattern like this:

word;clue

### Pros:
I had so much fun while developing this application. I'm happy that the crossword can handle with no matter of the password's length you will give (only letters are allowed). It will generate every crossword and it is really funny to see. You can just prepare and replace the file with the words and clues and generate the crossword in your language.


### Cons:
During the development I tried to create unit tests but I didn't make it like I wanted at the beginning. I only created few tests at the very beginning, nothing else. I'm also not happy that I didn't use any of the design patterns, but I really could - it is maybe cause of my laziness and because I wanted to make it quick and working...


Anyway, enjoy and use and have fun! :)
